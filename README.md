# Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing on DVWA

This project is part of the *Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Internship* provided by *Snestorn Internships*.

## 🧠 Objective
To perform vulnerability assessment and penetration testing on a simulated vulnerable web application using the *DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)* hosted on *TryHackMe*.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- TryHackMe Platform
- DVWA Room (Walkthrough)
- Virtual Machine AttackBox (TryHackMe)
- Web Browser
- [Optional] Burp Suite / OWASP ZAP / Terminal tools

## 🚀 Steps Followed

1. *Enrolled in the TryHackMe Pre-Security Path*
   - Topics included: Offensive Security, Defensive Security, Careers in Cyber

2. *Launched the DVWA Room*
   - Used TryHackMe’s virtual lab environment
   - Accessed the DVWA virtual machine through AttackBox

3. *Performed Simulated Attacks on DVWA*
   - Logged into DVWA with default credentials
   - Explored vulnerabilities like:
     - SQL Injection (SQLi)
     - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
     - Command Injection
     - CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
   - Observed how the application responded and learned exploit patterns

4. *Completed the Room*
   - Successfully completed the DVWA walkthrough
   - Marked as complete on TryHackMe

## 📂 Findings (Summary)

- Learned to navigate and test a vulnerable web app in a safe environment.
- Understood real-world vulnerabilities through hands-on simulation.
- Gained familiarity with web application security testing tools and concepts.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This internship project gave me practical experience in identifying and testing vulnerabilities in a simulated environment. I learned ethical hacking basics and practiced hands-on skills through TryHackMe’s beginner-friendly interface.
